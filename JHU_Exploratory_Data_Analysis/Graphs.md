## Principles of Graphs

_These notes are taken from the lecture "Principles of Analytic Graphics" by Dr. Roger Peng, based on the work by Edward_

### 1. Show comparisons

- Evidence for a hypothesis is always _relative_ to another competing hypothesis
- Always ask: "Compared to what?"
- Always show something relative to something else


### 2. Show causality, mechanism, explanation, systematic structure

- What is your causal framework for thinking about a question?

- Create graphics to show what you think is happening
- Your graphics can offer an explanation to what is happening

### 3. Show multivariate data

- Multivariate = more than 2 variables
- The real world is multivariate
- Need to "escape flatland"

### 4. Integration of evidence

- Integrate words, numbers, images, diagrams (tables, plots, text together)
- Make use of as many modes of evidence/data presentation as possible
- Do not let the tools drive the analysis : make the plots you want using the tools you have, but do not let the tools "do the thinking"

### 5. Describe and document the evidence with appropriate labels, scales, sources, etc.

- A data graphic should tell a complete story that is credible
- If using programs like R, be sure to document your code as well

### 6. Content is king

- Analytical presentations ultimately stand or fail depending on the quality, relevance, and integrity of their content

- First, think about what's the story you're trying to tell, what's the data you have, and then think about the best way to present it
