## Getting and Cleaning Data


This repository contains some of the notes I have acquired through (verified) participation in the course **Getting and Cleaning Data**.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Getting and cleaning data is the third course offered in the _Data Science Specialization_ offered by John Hopkins University via Coursera and was instructed by Prof. Jeff Leek, Prof. Roger Peng and Prof. Brian Caffo of the Bloomberg School of Public Health, JHU.

During this course, I was able to learn and practice the following:
* Reading a variety of file types into R including txt, csv, XML and JSON
* Acquiring data from web pages (web scraping), API's, HDF5 and MySQL
* Data manipulation:
    - subsetting and sorting
    - summarizing
    - creating new variables
    - reshaping data
    - merging data sets
  
  including the use of the _dplyr_ package to:
  * manipulate data
    - select()
    - mutate()
    - filter()
    - arrange()
    - summarise()
   * group data and chain commands
   * Tidy data by applying Hadley Wickham's three rules for a tidy data set
    
 * Editing text variables and regular expressions in the data set
 * Inserting, formatting, adjusting time using the _lubridate_ package
